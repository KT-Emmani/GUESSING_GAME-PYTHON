# GUESSING_GAME-PYTHON

New to Python, with the little knowledge I have acquired so far, I decided to try an interesting game project called the Guessing Game. This is a number guessing game where I ask the user to guess the number i picked.

With the use of some built-in module like Random and Time to pick the number randomly and give life to the programming.
